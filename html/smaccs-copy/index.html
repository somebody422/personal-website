      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I have long lost count of how many web sites I’ve built. You would think after having built a few hundred of them I would have discovered the “one true way” of doing it. I don’t think there is one true way. What I have discovered are techniques that can keep CSS more organized and more structured, leading to code that is easier to build and easier to maintain.</p>
      <p>I have been analyzing my process (and the process of those around me) and figuring out how best to structure code for projects on a larger scale. The concepts were vaguely there with the smaller sites that I had worked on but have become more concrete as a result of working on increasingly complex projects. Small sites don’t often hit the same pain points as larger sites or working with larger teams; small sites aren’t as complex and don’t change as often. However, what I describe in these pages is an approach that works equally well for sites small and large.</p>
