      <p class="italic">What are you wearing right now?</p>
      <p>Wait, that was a little creepy. Let me reword that.</p>
      <p>Think about the outfit you’re currently wearing. What does your outfit say about you?</p>
      <p>Often times (whether right or wrong) people make a first impression based on the clothes you wear.</p>
      <p>They make assumptions about things like your style, your personality, your age, or even the type of impression you want to make.</p>
      <p>There are also different outfits for different occasions.</p>
      <p>For example, you wouldn’t wear a bathing suit to a job interview.</p>
      <p>The same can be said about the fonts you choose to use in your branding and in your website's design.</p>
